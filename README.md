# Javascript Noughts and Crosses project

Noughts-and-crosses game against an AI opponent.

Players can interact with the GUI, which includes functionality for resetting the game, showing an outline of where their piece will be placed and functionality for switching players.

The AI opponent is impossible to beat as it uses the Minimax algorithm (with alpha-beta pruning for optimisation).
